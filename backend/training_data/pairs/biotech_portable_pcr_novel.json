    "BRIEF_OVERVIEW_LAYPERSON": "This invention addresses the need for portable DNA/RNA testing in field or remote settings. Traditional PCR equipment is large, expensive, and requires laboratory facilities. Our innovation enables real-time quantitative PCR in a portable, battery-powered device that can be operated by non-specialists.\n\nThe device uses a novel convective thermocycling approach where reagents flow through zones of different temperatures, eliminating the need for bulky heating blocks. A compact optical detection system monitors fluorescent signals in real-time, allowing users to detect and quantify target nucleic acids within minutes.\n\nThis technology addresses an unmet need for rapid diagnostics in remote areas, field research, and emergency response scenarios. Healthcare workers can now perform molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care without transporting samples to centralized laboratories.\n\nThe invention is classified as a novel process and apparatus combination. It provides benefits including: (1) mobility—enables testing anywhere, (2) speed—results in <30 minutes, (3) affordability—significantly lower equipment costs, and (4) ease of use—minimal training required.",
    "TYPE_CLASSIFICATION": "Novel apparatus and process combination; improvement on existing thermal cycling designs",
    "TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION": "The apparatus comprises three core subsystems:\n\n1. Temperature Control Unit: A miniaturized heating and cooling system using Peltier elements and thermal exchangers creates discrete temperature zones (95°C for denaturation, 50-65°C for annealing, 72°C for extension). The asymmetric circulation-enabling container creates a closed-loop pathway where reagents continuously flow through these zones in a single-directional convective pattern, eliminating the need for rapid heating/cooling transitions.\n\n2. Detection Optics: A compact light source (LED or laser) excites fluorescent dyes (SYBR Green, FAM, ROX) within the flowing reagent stream. A photo-detector positioned at the optical axis captures emitted fluorescence. Real-time monitoring during each PCR cycle enables Ct (cycle threshold) determination and quantification.\n\n3. Control Electronics: A microprocessor-based system with integrated temperature sensors (thermistors) maintains target temperatures within ±0.5°C. Data acquisition occurs at 1 Hz, capturing fluorescence intensity across all PCR cycles. Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth) enables data transmission to a smartphone app for result interpretation.\n\nProof-of-concept testing demonstrates: (a) 30-minute total run time for virus detection (100 copies/µL to 10^7 copies/µL dynamic range), (b) sensitivity equivalent to bench-top qPCR instruments, (c) battery operation >50 cycles on single charge, (d) device weight <2 kg.",
    "SUPPORTING_DATA": "Validation experiments show 99.2% correlation (R²=0.99) between portable device Ct values and conventional thermal cycler results across viral targets (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza). Clinical pilot study with 150 nasopharyngeal swabs achieved 96.8% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity vs. laboratory reference standard.",
    "PRIOR_FINDINGS": "Existing approaches include: (1) Fixed thermal cycler labs—established but immobile, (2) Traditional portable PCR—requires cooling water circulation, heavy batteries, (3) Microfluidic PCR chips—emerging but lack real-time quantification.\n\nKey innovations vs. prior art: Our convective thermocycling eliminates mechanical thermal cycling, reducing power consumption by 60%. Real-time detection integrated into portable format addresses a gap left by existing microfluidic solutions that lack quantitative capability in mobile formats.",
    "STAGE_OF_DEVELOPMENT": "Current Status: Laboratory prototype tested with clinical samples. The device successfully performs qPCR and qRT-PCR on 50 different targets.\n\nDevelopment Completed: Thermal control algorithm refined through 200+ test runs; optical detection calibrated for multiple fluorophores; wireless data transmission validated.\n\nRemaining Work: (1) Reagent formulation optimization for room-temperature storage, (2) User interface refinement for field operators, (3) Regulatory pathway assessment for clinical diagnostics, (4) Manufacturing scale-up to assess production costs.",
