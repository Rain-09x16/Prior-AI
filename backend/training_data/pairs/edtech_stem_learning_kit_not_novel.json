    "BRIEF_OVERVIEW_LAYPERSON": "This application describes an educational kit combining physical science materials with a digital app that displays educational content. The core architecture—physical experimental set items linked to a computer system with detection and display of relevant media—is substantially disclosed in prior art, most notably US10964228B2 (Mel Science Limited, 2021).\n\nThe present application lacks meaningful innovation.",
    "TYPE_CLASSIFICATION": "Combination of known elements (educational kit + digital media system)",
    "TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION": "Kit comprises physical experimental materials (test tubes, chemicals, apparatus). A mobile app displays educational videos and instructions when users interact with kit items. This architecture is substantially identical to that disclosed in US10964228B2, which explicitly discloses: 'educational system including...experimental set comprising experimental set items, and computer system...configured to display educational media content...in response to detector detecting an item.'",
    "SUPPORTING_DATA": "User testing shows 60% engagement increase vs. kit-alone condition. This modest improvement is already captured in prior art studies (US10964228B2 demonstrates 70%+ engagement gains).",
    "PRIOR_FINDINGS": "US10964228B2 (Mel Science Limited, granted 2021) directly anticipates the present application. The reference explicitly discloses: modular experimental kits with media integration, detection systems triggering content display, and computer-mediated learning. The present application merely arranges these known elements.",
